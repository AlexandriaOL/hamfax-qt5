    <h2>about HamFax</h2>

    <p>HamFax is an application for sending and receiving facsimilies in
      amateur radio. You can either use a sound card as interface to the
      transceiver or a SCS-PTC-II. Receiving of weather facsimile broadcasts 
      is also possible.</p>

    <h2>about facsimiles</h2>

    <h3>general</h3>

    <p>Facsimiles are pictures which are transmitted line by line. The sending
      and receiving station have to agree on the transmission speed LPM
      (meaning lines per minute) and the IOC (index of cooperation) which
      corresponds the line width. The information transmitted is the
      brightness of the current position.</p>

    <p>The beginning of a transmission is marked with a APT start signal (APT
      stands for automatic picture transmission).
    
    <h3>short wave facsimiles</h3> 

    <p>Facsimiles on short wave are frequency modulated, that means the
      frequency of the carrier is changing with the transmitted information
      (the current brightness). Usually the deviation is 400Hz, so the
      frequency for white is 800Hz higher than the one for black.</p>

    <h3>weather satellites</h3>

    <p>For receiving facsimiles from a weather satellite a suitable FM
      receiver is needed. The output of this receiver is a amplitude modulated
      signal where the maximum amplitude corresponds to white and no amplitude
      means black.</p>
