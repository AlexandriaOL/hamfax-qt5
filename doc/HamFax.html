    <h2>about HamFax</h2>

    <p>HamFax is an application for sending and receiving facsimilies in
      amateur radio. You can either use a sound card as interface to the
      transceiver or a SCS-PTC-II. Receiving of weather facsimile broadcasts 
      is also possible.</p>

    <p>The program is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public
      License. See http://hamfax.sourceforge.net/ for further information
      and new releases.</p>

    <h2>about facsimiles</h2>

    <h3>general</h3>

    <p>Facsimiles are pictures which are transmitted line by line. The sending
      and receiving station have to agree on the transmission speed (LPM
      stands for lines per minute) and the IOC (index of cooperation) which
      corresponds the line width. The information transmitted is the
      brightness of the current position.</p>

    <p>The beginning of a transmission is marked with a APT start signal (APT
      stands for automatic picture transmission). Usually this is a black/white
      pattern which changes between black and white at 300Hz.</p>
    
    <h3>short wave facsimiles</h3> 

    <p>Facsimiles on short wave are frequency modulated, that means the
      frequency of the carrier is changing with the transmitted information
      (the current brightness). Usually the deviation is 400Hz, so the
      frequency for white is 800Hz higher than the one for black.</p>

    <h3>weather satellites</h3>

    <p>For receiving facsimiles from a weather satellite a suitable FM
      receiver is needed. The output of this receiver is a amplitude modulated
      signal where the maximum amplitude corresponds to white and no amplitude
      means black.</p>

    <h2>using HamFax</h2>

    <h3>interface setup</h3>

    <p>You can either use a SCS PTC-II as modulator and demodulator or
      connect a sound card to your transceiver. For the PTC refer to the
      manual, especially the chapter about interfacing transceiver, PTC and
      computer. When using a sound card you need to connect line-out to the
      microphone input (or something similar) of the transceiver and line-in to
      some output of the transceiver. The RTS signal of a serial port can be
      used to key the PTT as it is often use for PSK31. A simple transistor is
      often enough to do the job.</p>

    <p>For both interfaces you have to switch your transceiver to USB (upper
      side band). In HamFax set carrier to 1900kHz and tune your transceiver
      1900kHz below the desired frequency.</p>
    
    <h3>receiving facsimiles</h3>

    <p>Set deviation, modulation apt start and stop frequencies, lpm, the type
      of phasing lines (normal or inverted) and the mono/color switch to the
      appropriate values. Then choose the desired interface in the receive menu
      and see what happens. :)</p>

    <p>If the apt start tone is not detected properly or you missed it you can
      skip it by clicking the skip button. If you missed the phasing lines you
      can skip the phasing detection and the value from the lpm checkbox is
      used.</p>

    <p>While receiving the raw data is stored in memory. So it is possible to
      correct the received image with the menu items in the Image menu. The
      image can be saved in any format supported by Qt.</p>

    <h3>sending facsimiles</h3>

    <p>Load the image from somewhere. Then set the control items to the desired
      values and scale the image to the desired IOC. Just select the right item
      from the transmit menu and you are on the way.</p>
