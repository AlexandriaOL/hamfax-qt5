HamFax v0.4
***********

Copyright (C) 2001 Christof Schmitt, DH1CS <christof.schmitt@gmx.de>

HamFax is a QT/X11 application for sending and receiving
facsimiles. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
see the file COPYING for the complete text.

If your have questions or comments please send them to me
(christof.schmitt@gmx.de). I want to have some feedback on this program.

New versions of this program can be found at
http://hamfax.sourceforge.net/

Requirements:
************

Hardware:
 - computer (of course)
 - transceiver
 - a working sound card and/or a SCS-PTC (http://www.scs-ptc.com/)

Software:
 - Linux (Other operating systems may work, too.)
 - X11
 - Qt v2.2 or newer (http://www.trolltech.com/)
 - Audiofile (http://www.68k.org./~michael/audiofile/)

Note: They are standard packages in most recent linux distributions.

Notes / Features:
*****************

 - All image formats supported by Qt can be used.
 
 - Facsimiles written to a AU-file have a sample rate of 8000Hz and
   16Bit/sample. This is the same format used for reading from and
   writing to the sound interface.

 - The data rate between the SCS-PTC and the computer can be set
   to 38400bit/s, 57600bit/s or 115200bit/s. With the start of
   transmission or reception the PTC is expected to be in the
   main menu. If HamFax does not put the PTC in fax mode, just
   turn it off and on, and it should work. ;-)

 - While doing frequency modulation (used on shortwave), the PTC
   mode JVCOMM is used which does hardware handshaking on the
   serial line. With amplitude modulation (used on transmissions
   from satellites) the mode AMFAX is used, which does no
   handshake at all, so data might get lost.
 
 - Transmitting:
    - Check the options menu and adjust everything as you need
    - Load the desired image with File->Open
    - Set the transmission parameters
    - Use Image->'Scale to ICO' to adjust the image size to the
      desired index of cooperation (IOC).
    - Select the desired mode in the transmit menu
 - Reception:
    - Set the parameters (note: the apt and phasing length are ignored)
    - Select the desired mode in the receive menu

see file TODO for information on missing features

Installation:
*************

With SuSE Linux 7.2 or a similar version you need the rpm packages qt,
qt-devel and audiofile.  After unpacking the archive, locate your qt
directory and type (with the correct directories):

./configure --with-Qt-dir=/usr/lib/qt2 --with-Qt-includes=/usr/lib/qt2/include

On some systems like Debian 2.2 it will suffice to install the packages
for qt and audiofile and run

./configure

If something goes wrong it is best to delete config.cache before
retrying configure.  After successful creation of the Makefile type

make

to compile it. As root use 

make install

to copy the program files to their directories. Default prefix
is '/usr/local'.
