HamFax v0.2
***********

Copyright (C) 2001 Christof Schmitt, DH1CS <cschmit@suse.de>

HamFax is a QT/X11 application for sending and receiving
facsimiles. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
see the file COPYING for the complete text.

If your have questions or comments please send them to me
(cschmit@suse.de). I want to have some feedback on this program.

New versions of this program can be found at
http://hamfax.sourceforge.net/

Requirements:
************

Hardware:
 - computer (of course)
 - transceiver
 - a working sound card and/or a SCS-PTC (http://www.scs-ptc.com/)

Software:
 - Linux (Sorry, i could not test other operating systems, they may work too.)
 - X11
 - Qt v2.2 or newer (http://www.trolltech.com/)
 - Audiofile (http://www.68k.org./~michael/audiofile/)


Notes / Features:
*****************

 - The supported image format for loading and saving is PNG.
 - Facsimiles written to a AU-file have a sample rate of 8000Hz and
   16Bit/sample. This is the same format as used for reading from and
   writing to the sound interface.
 - The data rate between the SCS-PTC and the computer is
   57600bit/s. With the start of transmission or reception the PTC is
   expected to be in the main menu. If HamFax does not put the PTC in
   fax mode, just turn it off and on, and it should work. ;-)
 - Serial communication to the SCS-PTC is not perfect, data might get lost...
 - Transmitting:
    - Set the appropiate devices in Options->'Device Settings'
      (they are not saved at the moment)
    - If you want to key your PTT using the RTS signal of the selected
      serial port select Options->'key PTT'
    - Load the desired image with File->Open
    - Adjust the parameters at the left
    - Use Options->'Scale Image' to adjust the image size to the
      desired index of cooperation (IOC).
    - Select the desired mode in the transmit menu
 - Reception:
    - Set the parameters (note: the apt and phasing length are ignored)
    - Select the desired mode in the receive menu

see file TODO for information on missing features

Installation:
*************

With SuSE Linux 7.2 or a similar version you need the rpm packages qt,
qt-devel and audiofile.  After unpacking the archive, locate your qt
directory and type (with the correct directories):

./configure --with-Qt-dir=/usr/lib/qt2 --with-Qt-includes=/usr/lib/qt2/include

On some systems like Debian 2.2 it is enough to install the packages
for qt and audiofile and run

./configure

If something goes wrong it is best to delete config.cache before
retrying configure.  After successful creation of the Makefile type

make

to compile it. If you want you can install the resulting binary
'hamfax' to /usr/local/bin/ with

make install

You have to be root to run this last command.
