HamFax v0.0
***********

Copyright (C) 2001 Christof Schmitt <cschmit@suse.de>

HamFax is a QT/X11 application for sending and receiving
facsimiles. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
see the file COPYING for the complete text.

If your have questions or comments please send them to me
(cschmit@suse.de). I want to have some feedback on this program.

Requirements:
************

Hardware:
 - computer (of course)
 - transceiver
 - a working sound card and/or a SCS-PTC (http://www.scs-ptc.com/)

Software:
 - Linux (Sorry, i could not test other operating systems, they may work too.)
 - X11
 - Qt v2.2 or newer (http://www.trolltech.com/)
 - Audiofile (http://www.68k.org./~michael/audiofile/)


Notes / Features:
*****************

 - The supported image format for loading and saving is PNG.
 - Facsimiles written to a AU-file have a sample rate of 8000Hz and
   16Bit/sample. This is the same format as used for reading and
   writing from the sound interface.
 - The data rate between the SCS-PTC and the computer is
   57600bit/s. With the start of transmission or reception the PTC is
   expected to be in the main menu. If HamFax does not put the PTC in
   fax mode, just turn it off and on, and it should work. ;-)
 - Transmitting:
    - Set the appropiate devices in Options->'Device Settings'
      (they are not saved at the moment)
    - If you want to key your PTT using the RTS signal of the selected
      serial port select Options->'key PTT'
    - Load the desired image with File->Open
    - Adjust the parameters at the left
    - Use Options->'Scale Image' to adjust the image size to the
      desired index of cooperation (IOC).
    - Select the desired mode in the transmit menu
 - Reception:
    - Set the parameters (note: the apt and phasing length are ignored)
    - Select the desired mode in the receive menu

see file TODO for information on missing features

Installation:
*************

After unpacking the archive, locate your qt directory and type (with
the correct directories):

./configure --with-Qt-dir=/usr/lib/qt2 --with-Qt-includes=/usr/lib/qt2/include

Note: It is possible, that

./configure

is enough, on my SuSE Linux 7.2 box i have to specify the path to
Qt. After successful creation of the Makefile type

make

to compile it. If you want you can install the resulting binary
'hamfax' to /usr/local/bin/ with

make install

You have to be root to run this last command.
