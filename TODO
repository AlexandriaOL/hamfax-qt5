to do:
- test AM
- real "on air test"
- translation (at least to german)
- CW id before and after transmission
- menu for some "standard modes"
- switch for deciding whether to determine the lpm from phasing
   lines or use a fixed value; adding a control for rx lpm
- possibility for changing lpm after reception to specific value
   (slant correction does this implicitly)
- switch for deciding whether to wait for apt start (and stop?)
- move correct dialog, etc. to FaxImage (?)
- correct beginning of line out of stored samples
   (necessary for correction of color facsimile)
- add slider to dialogs for selecting ioc
- allow 1% deviation from set sample rate
   (according to Franco Spinelli <fraspin@tin.it> some cheap sound cards
    behave this way)
- allow minimal carrier frequency of 800Hz (1500Hz is a arbitrary restriction)
- possibility for permanent slant correction
- frequency / brightness scale for spectrum
- automatic reception (perhaps a background/daemon process doing the work)
- setting the frequency on the transceiver and doing the work
   (have a look at hamlib)
