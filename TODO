First of all:
- change internal code layout (class and object structure, ...);
   the current one is not very nice for making changes

Little fixes and easy features:
- use correct types (size_t, ssize_t, ...)
- possibility for selecting available input/output
- menu for some "standard modes"
- add slider to dialogs for selecting ioc
- frequency / brightness scale for spectrum
- switch for deciding whether to wait for apt start (and stop?)

to do:
- documentation
- test AM
- real "on air test"
- switch for deciding whether to determine the lpm from phasing
   lines or use a fixed value; adding a control for rx lpm
- possibility for changing lpm after reception to specific value
   (slant correction does this implicitly)
- correct beginning of line out of stored samples
   (necessary for correction of color facsimile)
- possibility for permanent slant correction
- automatic generation of dependencies (automake, gcc -M or ?)
- some kind of preview while decoding apt and phasing lines

Features for the far future: (HamFax2; is anyone interested?)
- CW id before and after transmission
- automatic reception (perhaps a background/daemon process doing the work)
- setting the frequency on the transceiver, perhaps having a daemon process
   (have a look at hamlib)
